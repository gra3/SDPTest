/*Using this function:
-All of the helper functions will work if there are 5 or 6 cards in a players hand.
-The odds based on outs changes if you have 5 cards or 6 cards in hand.
-The number of outs does not change for 5 cards or 6 cards in had assumming no runner runner outs.
-Two calling functions will need used one for 5 cards held one for 6 cards held.
-This is because if a player has 2 cards to be dealt the odds are outs/47 and outs/46
	while if a player has only one card to be dealt the odds are outs/46.
-The decison to use the 5 card or 6 card odds call should be made dynamically by a function created
	here so the main GSM only needs to call a generic odds class regardless of number of cards held.
-When runner runner odds are implemented all runner runner calculations need placed in an if 
	statment specifying something like if (hand.size == 5) {} so the functions remain independant of 
	handsize with a large number of possabilities in the {}*/
